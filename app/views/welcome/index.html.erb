		<p class="splash-custom about" id="abt-paragraph">Pet ID helps pet owners find their lost pets. How does it work? A Pet owner simply creates a account and registers their pets. Note that any personal information won't be shared. After siging in and adding a pet, the owner can add a photo and a full description of their pet. Later they can easily update their pets description, and report their pets as lost if needed. After the pet is reported lost, the pet appears within to the lost pet listing. The lost pet listing can be seen by anyone, meaning that a login is not required. The lost pet listing includes lost pet photos as well as the pet's names and the locations where they were lost. Once the pet is identified, email can sent to the owner. The sender's contact information is included within the email sent. The pet owner can then contact the sender and reunite with their pet and update the pet as found. Awesome, Fluffy is heading back home!</p>
